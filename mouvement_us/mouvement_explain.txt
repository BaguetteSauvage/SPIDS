//////// The role of previous_distance //////////
How is it changed at every loop : 
1/ If the is a significant (ie more than "tolerance" between previous_distance and the new mesured) 
change in the mesured distance, we completely change previous_distance 
and switch it to the newx mesured distance. 
Then we switch the value of mouvement = True

2/ If there is little variation :  => Mouvement = False 
We don't change the value of previous_distance
